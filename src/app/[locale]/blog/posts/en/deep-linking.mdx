## Introduction
Deep linking is a technique that allows users to navigate directly to a specific page or content within a mobile or web application, rather than just opening the home page. It enhances user experience by providing seamless redirection from external sources like websites, social media, emails, or search engines.

There are three main types of deep linking:

1. **Traditional Deep Linking** — Works only if the app is installed. Clicking a deep link opens the specific page inside the app.
2. **Deferred Deep Linking** — Redirects users to the App Store or Play Store if the app is not installed and then opens the intended content after installation.
3. **Universal/App Links** — Uses platform-specific solutions (Apple Universal Links for iOS and Android App Links) to automatically open the app when a supported URL is clicked.

## Setting Up Deep Linking in Web Apps

### Creating Site Association/Digital Asset Link Files
To create deep linking in a web application, we need to maintain an association/Digital Asset Links file. When our website link is entered into a mobile browser, whether it’s iOS or Android, if the association file is available, the browser will open our app. For example, if you search for any reel link in a web browser, it will open in the Instagram app.

### iOS: Creating the Apple App Site Association (AASA) File

#### 1. Create the `.well-known` Directory
The AASA file (without an extension) must be placed in a `.well-known` directory at the root of your domain. Your folder structure should look like this:

```
/your-domain.com
 ├── .well-known/
 │   ├── apple-app-site-association
```

#### 2. Create the AASA JSON File
Create an `apple-app-site-association` file and add the following JSON content:

```json
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "TEAM_ID.BUNDLE_ID",
                "paths": [
                    "/products/*",
                    "/cart",
                    "/checkout",
                    "NOT /admin/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of Fields
- **appID**: This is a combination of your Apple Developer Team ID and the app’s Bundle ID. Example: `"appID": "ABCDE12345.com.yourcompany.webshop"`
- **paths**: Defines which URLs should open inside the app.
    - `"/*"` – Opens all pages in the app.
    - `"/products/*"` – Opens any URL under `/products/` in the app.
    - `"NOT /admin/*"` – Ensures that `/admin/` pages do not open in the app.

#### 3. Host the AASA File on Your Web Server
The file must be publicly accessible over HTTPS:

```
https://your-domain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

---

### Android: Creating the Digital Asset Links File (DAL)
The Digital Asset Links (DAL) file is required to enable Android App Links, allowing links to open directly in the app instead of a browser when the app is installed. This file is hosted on your domain and verifies the association between your website and your Android app.

#### 1. Create the `.well-known` Directory

```
/your-domain.com
 ├── .well-known/
 │   ├── assetlinks.json
```

#### 2. Create the `assetlinks.json` File
Inside the `.well-known` directory, create a file named `assetlinks.json` and add the following JSON content:

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.yourcompany.webshop",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        "AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:12:34"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### Explanation of Fields
- **relation**: Defines the type of permission granted. `"delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"` ensures all links matching this domain open in the app.
- **package_name**: The Android package name of your app (found in `AndroidManifest.xml`).
- **sha256_cert_fingerprints**: The SHA-256 fingerprint of your app’s signing certificate.

#### 3. Get Your SHA-256 Certificate Fingerprint
**Method 1:** From Google Play Console
- Go to **Google Play Console** → **Setup** → **App Signing** → Copy the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint.

**Method 2:** Using the Command Line
Run the following command:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore your-key.jks -alias your-alias -storepass your-storepass
```

## Implementing Deep Linking in Mobile Apps

### Android: App Links and Handling `autoVerify` Attribute
Add the following `intent-filter` inside the `<activity>` tag in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="https"
          android:host="your-domain.com"
          android:pathPrefix="/products" />
</intent-filter>
```

---

### iOS Configurations
For iOS, Universal Links are used to handle deep linking. These links allow iOS apps to open directly from a web link without opening Safari first.

**Enable Associated Domains in Xcode**
- Open your Xcode project.
- Navigate to **Signing & Capabilities**.
- Click the **“+”** button → Add **Associated Domains**.
- Add the domain in this format: `applinks:your-domain.com`

## Challenges and Solutions in Deep Linking

### 1. URL Pattern Discrepancies
**Issue:** URL structures may differ between web and mobile apps, causing deep link failures.

**Solution:** Standardize URL structures across both platforms or implement dynamic path mapping.

### 2. Security Concerns
**Issue:** Deep linking can expose sensitive pages to unauthorized users.

**Solution:** Implement authentication checks and token-based validation.

### 3. Expo CLI and Testing Bottlenecks
**Issue:** Testing deep linking in Expo can be challenging since the development server does not fully simulate deep linking behavior.

**Solution:** Test with Expo Go and use ADB commands for Android and Universal Link Simulator in Xcode for iOS.

## Conclusion
Deep linking is a crucial feature for modern webshops, enhancing user experience by enabling direct navigation to specific in-app content. Implementing it effectively requires addressing technical challenges, security concerns, and testing limitations.

**Summary of Key Insights:**
- Deep linking improves user engagement and conversion rates.
- Correct configuration of AASA and DAL files is essential for seamless functionality.
- Ensuring URL structure consistency minimizes link failures.
- Implement security measures like authentication checks and token validation.
- Testing in a staging environment is crucial before production deployment.
