## Problem Statement
The existing manual methods for managing projects, tracking financial transactions, and monitoring volunteer activity were inefficient and error-prone. The key challenges included:
- **Project and Activity Management** – Difficulty in managing project timelines and tracking volunteer progress using Google Sheets.
- **Financial Management** – Complex financial hierarchy with multiple permission levels, making it hard to track expenses and generate accurate reports.
- **Volunteer Management** – Challenges in tracking volunteer contributions and issuing service letters efficiently.

---

## Proposed Solution
A **user policy-based system** was designed to resolve these issues:
1. **Project Management** – Creation of dynamic dashboards for project creation, progress tracking, and team assignments.
2. **Financial Management** – Integration of financial transaction tracking and automated report generation.
3. **Volunteer Management** – Implementation of a volunteer dashboard to monitor progress and generate service letters.

## Technologies Used
The platform was built using:
- **Frontend:** React.js with Vite, Redux.js, Bootstrap, CSS
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Hosting:** AWS
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma
- **API Testing:** Postman

## Implementation
### Key Features:
✅ **Dynamic Project Dashboard** – Displays ongoing, completed, and pending projects with real-time status updates.  
✅ **Financial Management** – Enables tracking of income, expenses, and budget allocation.  
✅ **Volunteer Management** – Monitors volunteer progress and generates automated service letters.  
✅ **User Roles and Permissions** – Provides role-based access for chairpersons, treasurers, and volunteers.  
✅ **Notification System** – Sends real-time notifications about project updates and deadlines.

## Challenges and Solutions
### 1. **Complex Hierarchy Handling**
- Challenge: Managing multiple levels of user roles and permissions.
- Solution: Implemented a flexible user policy-based system to define permissions dynamically.

### 2. **Financial Oversight**
- Challenge: Tracking financial transactions and generating accurate reports.
- Solution: Built a financial module integrated with project data for real-time tracking and reporting.

### 3. **Data Consistency and Security**
- Challenge: Ensuring consistent data across different modules.
- Solution: Used Redux.js for state management and implemented secure API calls with Spring Boot.

## Outcome and Impact
- **Efficiency** – Reduced project tracking time by 40%.  
- **Transparency** – Improved financial reporting and accountability.  
- **Volunteer Engagement** – Increased volunteer participation due to better progress tracking and recognition.  

## Conclusion
The Student Branch Operations Platform significantly enhanced the operational efficiency of the IEEE Student Branch at UWU. By integrating project, financial, and volunteer management into a unified platform, the project addressed the complexities of hierarchical structures and improved overall transparency and communication.
